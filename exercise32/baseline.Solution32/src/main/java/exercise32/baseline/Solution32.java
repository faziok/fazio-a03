     * GUESS THE NUMBER GAME:
     * Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of difficulty.
     * The first level of difficulty would be a number between 1 and 10.
     * The second difficulty set would be between 1 and 100.
     * The third difficulty set would be between 1 and 1000.
     *
     * Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game.
     * The computer picks a random number in that range and prompts the player to guess that number.
     * Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to whether the number
     * is too high or too low. The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses.
     * Once the player guesses the correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses and
     * ask if the player would like to play again.
     *
     * Constraints
     * -Donâ€™t allow any non-numeric data entry.
     * -During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong guesses.
